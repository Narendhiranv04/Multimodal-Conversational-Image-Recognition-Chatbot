**Multimodal Conversational Image Recognition Chatbot**

This project was developed as part of Smart India Hackathon-24, showcasing a multimodal chatbot capable of handling complex image-based queries. The chatbot integrates cutting-edge technologies to provide image segmentation, inpainting, and generation capabilities, combined with conversational intelligence to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience.

The system utilizes LLaVA, SAM2, and GLIGEN to process images for segmentation, inpainting, and generation tasks, while LSTM networks enhance the chatbot’s contextual understanding. Advanced keyword extraction techniques using RAKE and YAKE further refine conversational responses, making the chatbot reliable and accurate in addressing user queries.
